## Network Intrusion Detection

This project contains a machine learning pipeline for detecting network intrusions using various classification models. The goal is to differentiate between normal network activity and potential malicious attacks.

### Features:
- Data preprocessing tailored for network intrusion datasets.
- Implementation of multiple classifiers including:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of model performance for better interpretability.

### How to Use:
1. Load and preprocess the network intrusion dataset.
2. Train the models provided in the notebook.
3. Evaluate and compare the models based on the performance metrics.
4. Select the best performing model for deployment or further analysis.
